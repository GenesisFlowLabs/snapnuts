# Shortcut Content - Project Status

**Last Updated:** December 25, 2025
**Status:** IDEATION - Defining vision and structure

---

## Vision

Educational short-form content teaching keyboard shortcuts and productivity tips. Platform-agnostic (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok). Faceless format - value-first, personality optional.

**Working Title Ideas:**
- "Shortcut Academy"
- "Keys to Speed"
- "Command Everything"
- (TBD)

## Team Structure (EOS Model)

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Visionary** | Shafen | Ideas, direction, content strategy, creative vision |
| **Integrator** | CJ | Execution, editing, posting, systems, accountability |

**Commitment Level:** Side project (not full-time)

## Content Concept

### Format
- 15-60 second videos
- Screen recordings + text overlays or voiceover
- Faceless (optional to show face)
- One tip per video = high retention

### Content Categories
1. **macOS Native Shortcuts** - Built-in keyboard magic
2. **App-Specific Shortcuts** - Rectangle, Chrome, VS Code, etc.
3. **Window Management** - Tiling, snapping, organization
4. **Hidden Features** - Things people don't know exist
5. **Workflow Combos** - Chaining shortcuts for power moves

### Why It Works
- Algorithm loves utility content (high saves/shares)
- Evergreen - shortcuts don't change often
- Low production overhead - just screen + audio
- Scalable - can batch record dozens in one session

---

## Origin Story

Born from setting up Rectangle shortcuts:
- **0** = Tile All (zero mess)
- **2** = Thirds (two-thirds)
- **8** = Eighths (obvious)

Pattern recognition: **memorable number associations** = sticky learning

---

## Revenue Potential

- **Sponsorships** - Productivity apps, software tools
- **Affiliate** - Recommend apps like Rectangle, Alfred, Raycast
- **Digital Products** - Shortcut cheat sheets (PDF), wallpapers with shortcuts
- **Courses** - "Master macOS in 30 Days" type content

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Define)
- [ ] Name the channel/brand
- [ ] Pick primary platform (YouTube Shorts vs Reels vs both)
- [ ] Define CJ's compensation structure
- [ ] Create content calendar template

### Phase 1 (Build Foundation)
- [ ] Compile master list of macOS shortcuts worth covering
- [ ] Create recording setup (screen capture workflow)
- [ ] Design simple visual template (fonts, colors, style)
- [ ] Record first 10 test videos

### Phase 2 (Launch)
- [ ] Create accounts on chosen platforms
- [ ] Post first batch (3-5 videos)
- [ ] Analyze performance
- [ ] Iterate and scale

## Notes

- This is NOT a full-time commitment
- Quality over quantity at first
- Can be anonymous/faceless - no pressure to be "the face"
- Test with 10-20 videos before deciding to scale
