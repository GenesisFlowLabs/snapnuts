### Key Story Beats

1. **Origin (Dec 25, 2025)** - Shafen wanted numpad-based window management, Rectangle couldn't do it
2. **Hammerspoon Proof of Concept** - Quick validation of the "number = division" concept
3. **Native App (Jan 7, 2026)** - Aaron helped convert to proper Swift/SwiftUI app
4. **Crash Fixes (Jan 22-23, 2026)** - SwiftUI/AppKit race condition discovered after extended uptime
5. **Auto-Updates** - Added Sparkle framework so users get fixes automatically
6. **Smart Tiling** - Cmd+0 tiles all windows of same app intelligently

### AI Transparency Angle

Built openly with Claude. "Vibe coded" - humans provide vision, AI assists implementation. Honest attribution.

## Name Validation Plan

**Current name:** SnapNuts

**Validation strategy:**
1. Facebook friends (initial feedback)
2. LinkedIn (broader professional audience)
3. Consider alternatives if feedback suggests

**Questions to ask:**
- Does the name make sense for a window snapping app?
- Is it memorable?
- Any negative connotations we're missing?
- Alternative suggestions?
